# Cinema-Room-Manager
Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre. In this project, I have created an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and more.

## Things I learned during this Project :
1. Basics of Java
2. Operations
3. Conditionals & Loops
4. Characters and Strings
5. Arrays (1 Dimentional and multi Dimensional)
6. Methods
7. How JVM Works
8. Errors
